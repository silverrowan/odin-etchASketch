Currently baseline project complete.

A grid of 16x16 squares is generated, and the color of each square 
changes as you mouseover it.

The grid can be redrawn to any size up to 100 squares by clicking
the reset grid button.

When clicked: A prompt appears, asking for the size of grid to draw. 
If a non-number or restricted number (not an integer between 1-100, 
inclusive) is entered, an alert followed by re-prompt appears.

When a number between 1-100 is entered, the current grid is removed, 
and a new clean grid is created of the size specified.
