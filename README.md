Etch-a-sketch like project per The Odin Project

Currently baseline project complete.

A grid of 16x16 squares is generated, and the color of each square 
changes as you mouseover it.

The grid can be redrawn to any size up to 100 squares by clicking
the reset grid button.

When clicked: A prompt appears, asking for the size of grid to draw. 
If a non-number or restricted number (not an integer between 1-100, 
inclusive) is entered, an alert followed by re-prompt appears.

Currently if the cancel button is clicked an empty grid appears.
    Would it be better to leave the old grid in this case?
